Every job have times when extra work should be done for success of product, if you not perform it then it performs your superior or colleague. It's bad but could happen when planning was failed.

I would like to describe my feelings about it and my thoughts about such cases.

I think extra work hours is normal in 5 cases:

## 1. You need extra money and you can make it from extra hours

Sometimes you just need more money and it's more convenient to earn it on your main job. Some companies don't want developers to have freelance or project-based jobs, because it can scatter attention of developer and make a person tired of work. In worst scenarios it could lead to burnout.

So in this case extra work on your main job could be the best option for you. If you will have freelance or part time job, it will add more responsibility, and in the end of the day you will have responsibility from main job and from part time job. This could be hard and frustrating and it will be nightmare if you will have more work than you can manage.

My example with that case:

When I was in college, I created 3 graduate works at once. I implemented all of them in time, but stress that I get from it wasn't worth it. I had to spend some days without sleep and I spend all the money I received on accommodation, the costs of which could simply be optimized.

When you don't sleep at night for getting more money is RED FLAG üö©

## 2. When you create your own project

If it's your own project, not important if you create it for learning or for earnings, then it's normal to perform harder for it. 

Learning from implementing some projects is the best learning strategy for me, so time for it could be redistributed from time that you dedicate to learn something.

But if you work more or same amount of time at main job, then you need to think out this problem.

## 3. When you broke something ‚ùå

When you broke something (hopefully not on production) and you don't have backup from your team, then it's your responsibility to fix it ASAP.

It's frequently happening with me and I always try to fix such problems. But if you can't manage it and you have colleague that could help, then it's totally normal to get help.

## 4. When extra work can lead to amazing success

If you feel that your extra work could lead company or you to amazing success, it's bad idea to just go sleep. Sometimes intuition or just logical analyze tells you that 2 more hours of fixing problems could lead to success, if it's your story then just try to get result.

WARNING: It's only my opinion. Consider your actions. If you have problems with health never let it get worth. If you do extra work for more than 2-3 days because of trying get success, then try to replan your day and not sacrifice your health.

## 5. When extra work can help get new experience

Sometimes extra work can give new experience. For example when you can implement new project at work, as part of hackathon or helping the other team in your company.

If you will work with persons that develop themselves and try to be professional - such extra work could give experience in many areas.
