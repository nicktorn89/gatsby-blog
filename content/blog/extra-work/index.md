Every job has times when extra work is necessary for the success of a project. If you don't undertake it, your supervisor or colleague might have to step in. It's not ideal, but it can happen when planning has failed.

In this article, I'll share my feelings about extra work and provide insights on when it might be beneficial.

## 1. Pursuing extra money responsibly 

Sometimes, you need extra money, and earning it through additional hours on your main job can be more convenient. Some companies discourage developers from taking on freelance or project-based work to prevent distraction and burnout. In such cases, extra work on your main job might be the best option. Juggling a part-time job can add more responsibility, potentially leading to frustration and burnout.

Tip: Be cautious of taking on too much. Balancing a main job and a part-time job can be overwhelming, leading to burnout.

Example from my experience:

During my time in college, I took on the challenge of creating three graduate works simultaneously. Although I managed to implement all of them on time, the stress I endured wasn't worth it. There were days when I had to go without sleep, and all the money I earned went towards accommodation expenses, which could have been optimized.

Working through the night to earn more money is a red flag üö©

## 2. Investing time in your own project 

If it's your own project, whether you create it for learning or for earnings, it's normal to put in extra effort.

Learning from implementing projects is the most effective strategy for me, so time for it could be reallocated from the time you dedicate to learning something else.

However, if you find yourself working the same amount of time or more at your main job, then you need to address this issue

## 3. Taking responsibility for mistakes 

If you've broken something ‚ùå (hopefully not in production) without team backup, fixing it becomes your responsibility. While it's common to face such challenges, seeking help from a colleague when needed is entirely acceptable.

Tip: Proactively seek assistance if a problem is beyond your immediate control.

## 4. Seizing opportunities for success

If your extra work could lead to significant success for you or your company, don't hesitate to put in the effort. Trust your intuition or logical analysis. However, be cautious and prioritize your health. Prolonged periods of excessive work can have adverse effects.

WARNING: It's only my opinion. Consider your actions. If you have problems with health never let it get worth. If you do extra work for more than 2-3 days because of trying get success, then try to replan your day and not sacrifice your health.

## 5. Gaining new experience through extra work 

Engaging in extra work can offer valuable experiences, such as implementing a new project at work or participating in a hackathon. Collaborating with professionals dedicated to personal growth can enhance your skills in various areas.

Tip: Choose opportunities that align with your personal and professional development goals.

## Conclusion

Extra work can be a double-edged sword. While it can lead to success and personal growth, it's crucial to navigate it responsibly to avoid burnout and maintain overall well-being. Consider your actions carefully, prioritize your health, and strive for a balanced approach to work and learning.

Tips for overcoming difficulties during additional work:

- Sleep as you normally do; never choose work over sleep.
- Drink water or green tea without sugar; this will help get rid of toxins in the brain.
- Get some sleep during the day if it's possible.
- Ask for help if you need it from your colleagues, relatives, or friends.
