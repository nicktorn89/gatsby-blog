Greetings to all who read this text!

My name is Vladislav, and I'm a Software Developer.

Currently, I'm working at Actonic GmbH on various interesting projects. However, I'm here to share with you, day by day, updates about myself, my own projects, or ideas. I primarily work with JavaScript, but I also enjoy learning and implementing projects with other programming languages.

I have diverse interests, including programming (my favorite), movies, books, and video games (the best ones). In this blog, I aim to share things related to technology, productivity, or just life in general.

Welcome to my blog, and let's have fun!

Vladislav Komanchy
